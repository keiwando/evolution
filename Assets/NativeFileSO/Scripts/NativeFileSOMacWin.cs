	/// <summary>
	/// Provides methods for native file open and save functionality which is
	/// shared between Windows and macOS.
	/// </summary>
	/// <example>
	/// The following example demonstrates how to use the <see cref="NativeFileSOMacWin"/>
	/// class in order to allow the user to select multiple paths of files to be opened.
	/// <code>
	/// using Keiwando.NFSO;
	/// 
	/// public class OpenPathsTest {
	///
	/// 	public static void Main() {
	///
	/// 		// We want the user to select paths to plain text files.
	/// 		SupportedFileType[] supportedFileTypes = {
	/// 			SupportedFileType.PlainText
	/// 		};
	/// 
	/// 		bool multiSelect = true; // Can select multiple paths at once
	/// 		string title = "Custom Title"; // The title of the panel
	/// 		string directory = ""; // Remember and reset to the previously selected directory
	/// 		NativeFileSOMacWin.shared.SelectOpenPaths(supportedFileTypes, 
	/// 		  mutltiSelect, title, directory,
	/// 		  delegate(bool pathsWereSelected, string[] paths) {
	/// 			if (pathsWereSelected) {
	/// 				// Process the information within the paths array.
	/// 			} else {
	/// 				// The file selection was cancelled.
	/// 			}
	/// 		});
	///		}
	/// }
	/// </code>
	/// 
	/// See also <see cref="NativeFileSO"/> for examples of how to use the more
	/// general API that also applies to mobile platforms.
	/// </example>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>Compared to the <see cref="NativeFileSO"/> class, the <see cref="NativeFileSOMacWin"/>
	/// class provides additional methods which cannot be implemented in the same 
	/// way on mobile platforms due to the different available native APIs.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>For example, on iOS and Android, the path to a selected file to be opened 
	/// is only temporarily valid due to native security features and access
	/// restrictions. Therefore, the entire file has to be copied into memory before
	/// its data can be handed over to the caller of the method.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>On desktop platforms, however, it is possible to provide methods that
	/// simply return the chosen file path for a save or open operation. This 
	/// then allows for more custom processing of the selected files. For example,
	/// the file contents can be loaded and processed in smaller chunks which is more 
	/// memory efficient and a preferred solution compared to loading the entire
	/// file contents into memory, which should only be done if necessary.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>This class is currently compatible with Windows and macOS. Attempting
	/// Attempting to call the class methods on unsupported platforms will result
	/// in a <see cref="NullReferenceException"/>.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>Thread safety is not guaranteed!</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>Note for macOS: The Open and Save API methods that take a completion 
	/// callback display the NSOpenPanel modally as a sheet, which makes it 
	/// anchored to the top of the window and non-draggable. The ..Sync variants
	/// of those calls, however, use a floating panel which is detached from the
	/// main application window and can be dragged around by the user.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>If the visual style of the panel is of importance to you, simply
	/// call the respective method.</para>
	/// 
	/// </remarks>
	/// <exception cref="NullReferenceException">
	/// Thrown when the API is attempted to be accessed on unsupported platforms.
